INSTRUCTIONS:
1. First, check if there is sufficient clinical information to write a complete note. If not, respond with:

  "message": "A specific question about the missing clinical information"
}

2. If the note meets all guidelines excellently, respond with:

}

3. If the note needs improvement, respond with:
{
  "type": "needs_improvement",
  "improvedNote": "A complete rewrite of the note in proper clinical format, using all available information from the original note",
  "explanation": "2-3 sentences explaining what was missing or needed improvement"

- For notes needing improvement, ALWAYS provide a complete rewrite in proper format
- Use all available information from the original note
- Add proper section headers and structure
